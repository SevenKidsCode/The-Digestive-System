# Human digestive system

## What is The Human digestive system?

The gastrointestinal system (or digestive system ) is the system of organs of multicellular animals which takes food, digests it to extract energy and nutrients , and expels the surplus fecal matter ..

Digestion is important for breaking down food into nutrients, which the body uses for energy, cell growth, and cell repair.
